Hi! My name is Ashley Louie and my [personal website](http://ashleylouie.com/) includes projects at the intersection of **urban analytics**, **design**, **spatial data**, **technology**, and **social advocacy**. I have a background in architecture and urban design and am passionate about cities and communities. Much of my current work bridges analysis of civic data with information design for actionable decision making.
