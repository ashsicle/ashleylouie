			<p>Through incentivization policies, developers were encouraged to create Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) in New York City by receiving a floor area ratio (FAR) bonus to adjacent buildings. However, these policies are regulated along prescriptive outcomes, which homogenize the development of plazas and arcades in midtown and lower Manhattan. In order to expand the opportunity of POPS to address the specific needs of a community, the performative spatial qualities should be documented and assessed relative to its neighborhood. Through guidelines established by the Open Space Index (OSI), The POPS Index weighs access to open space amenities of different neighborhoods in order to propose quality-based incentives for the creation of new Privately Owned Public Spaces.</p>
