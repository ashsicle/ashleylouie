			<p>In order for public engagement to be more meaningful to urban designers, participatory methods using agent-based simulations can allow stakeholders to intuitively play within design constraints. playLab.City provides a platform, situated between urban design participation and agent based simulation, where stakeholders have a greater opportunity to exercise their right to the city.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Participatory Urban Design</h2>
					<p>Urban design ambitiously tries to improve places for people, while also scrutinizing the city’s complex and interconnected networks at a variety of scales. At the intersection of architecture, landscape, and planning, teams of industry experts are often outsiders when faced with the challenge of designing for specific communities. These designers, who are used to building-industry jargon, need a way of communicating effectively with stakeholders in order to advocate for people’s right to the city. Although community outreach is often an integral part of inclusive participation in design, the playLab.City canvas allows stakeholders to directly input their ideas and learn from the agent-based simulation in order to make informed decisions on their programmatic input.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Communication Platform</h2>
					<p>playLab.City aims to improve communication between designers and the participants. Programming outreach usually involves surveys, maps, precedent images, and abstract bubble diagrams, however, these traditional methods limit the conversation to a one-way flow of information. The designer will explain the site context, then the participant will complete a survey, point at a map, pin a location, and talk about their desired program. Often times, this results in an unachievable wish list of programs, constrained by a number of external factors that are difficult for designers to convey.</p>
					<p>The interactive approach of playLab.City assists designers in simulating these design constraints, which can incite participants to provide feedback that goes beyond the surface-level wishlist. Through parameter-driven rules, like a game, participants intuitively learn benefits and consequences of design proposals and can play within this game-like framework and can encourage deeper discussions on speculative ideas relative to the design constraints, assumptions, and limitations of the program.</p>

			<h2 class="h2">Program</h2>
			<p>As a proof of concept, Hudson, NY was studied and serves as the context for proposed program objects, including: seating, bike-share, pop-up art, community center, plaza, library, mobile grocery, grocery store, and basketball court. Each program is weighted with a multiplier that establishes the strength of attraction for each demographic. The multiplier ranges between 0.0 to 10.0, where it represents the attraction strength to steer the agents. The program creation sliders on the sidebar allow users to create customized programs with specific levels of these three parameters. The intention here is to allow flexibility for the users to propose programs beyond the default programs and spark conversation with these ideas and discuss their impacts.</p>

				<div class="flex-1-1">
					<h2 class="h2">Program Creation</h2>
					<p>Each program is weighted with a multiplier that affects the attraction levels of each demographic agent. These variables can be adjusted, to better understand specific programmatic input tailored to attract specific demographic groups. Customizing levels of attraction to a particular program, adds flexibility to built-in assumptions and enriches the quality of the opinion-based feedback.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-1">
					<h2 class="h2">Environment</h2>
					<p>The environment shows the historic main street in the city of Hudson. Participants can change the environment by toggling the time of day, deploying program, and adjust parameters for program attractions. Typical street activity can be further developed in the agent-based simulation to encompass commute, weekend, or other patterns based on the time of day.</p><br>
				</div>
				<div class="flex-1-1">
					<h2 class="h2">Simulation Feedback</h2>
					<p>Agent-based simulation provides feedback with programmatic attraction as a proxy for design impact. If agents from one demographic group are attracted more than another group, seeing the feedback could spark conversation on who benefits from different design ideas and allows an opportunity for participants to affirm their reasons for introducing certain program or to revise proposal to better fit their goals.</p>

			<h2 class="h2">Agents</h2>
			<p>The model uses three agents, which align to significant stakeholders in the city of Hudson: visitors, low-income residents, and median-high income residents. During on-site studies in the City of Hudson, residents talked about growing concerns for gentrification, and the simulation aims to visualize the trade-offs between different actors' needs within the city. While the causes and effects of gentrification are complex, agent-based simulation demonstrates simplifies the potential impact as a direct response to programmatic inputs.</p>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-2-3">
					<h2 class="h2">Visitor</h2>
					<p>Visitors are transient, often staying for a leisurely weekend. They are attracted to “temporal” public programs, such as special events, pop-up installations, and bikeshares. These leisure activities are lower necessities in everyday life, in contrast to reliance on community resources like the library. Visitor agents are randomly assigned an income level, and will adapt to similar cost constraints as respective resident income levels.</p>

			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-2-3">
					<h2 class="h2">Resident, Low Income</h2>
					<p>As the City of Hudson continues to evolve, development brings unequal benefits, facilitating easier access to land and amenities for some, while compounding challenges for others. U.S. Census data shows that low-income residents who live in Hudson have limited access to a vehicle and other community amenities. Limited mobility and income will discourage residents from participating in antique fairs or pop-up art installations, which are often luxuries with unaffordable costs.</p>

				</fig>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="flex-2-3">
					<h2 class="h2">Resident, Medium to High Income</h2>
					<p>Similar to the low-income population, residents who live in more affluent areas of Hudson, also voiced a need for improved community infrastructure. Many of these residents, however, can also afford the lifestyle of enjoying boutique retail on Warren Street. These residents actively choose the lifestyle that Hudson provides, while are also supporters of making long-term improvements to the decaying public infrastructure.</p>

			</div><br>
			<h2 class="h2">Behaviors</h2>
			<p>Agent behaviors are applied globally, but agents’ movements are defined locally to achieve autonomy. The three main behaviors represent the three stage of the agent simulation: population generation, program interaction, and demographic change. Agents are randomly generated into the simulation environment, and are given a sight radius of which they will respond to the elements within their sight. Once programs are deployed, agents within their radius respond based on weighted levels of attraction with program values for cost, necessity, and frequency. [See Weighted Program Matrix in the table below.] Agents are defined to be encouraged or discouraged to stay in the simulated environment based on the types of programs deployed, which translates to a shift in the global population of agent types.</p>

			<p>PlayLab.City aims to achieve greater participatory design and more informed conversation where stakeholders understand design constraints. The interface becomes both a learning tool for the user and helps designers receive more informed feedback.</p>
