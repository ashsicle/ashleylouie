			<p>As an Industrial Business Zone, Long Island City East users are composed of NYC subway commuters and students. For the last half-mile (10 minute walk) from subway stations and throughout ancillary activities in the neighborhood, the pedestrian experience is thwarted by the megascale of industrial buildings, exposed to the danger of vehicle-dominated streets, and disproportionately limited with the lack of programmed amenities.</p>
			<p>With the use of colored paint and string structures, we propose to tactically deploy art installations as a territorial claim for the pedestrian right of way. Located throughout LIC East, the playful pilot interventions seek to combat pedestrian inequity in streets by slowing down drivers, encouraging external social interaction, and provoking community members to engage in opportunities to own and improve their neighborhood.</p>
			<p>Incorporating feedback from the temporary interventions, the long-term street improvements can be installed. With the aid of our design manual, the momentum gained from the colorful installations will empower private owners to see the benefits of transforming vacant lot spaces into programmed open space and community members to take ownership in active participation in building a better pedestrian experience.</p>
			<p>Further project information coming soon!</p>
